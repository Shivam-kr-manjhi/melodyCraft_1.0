Welcome to Music-Craft, where you can create your own melody with just a few simple steps!

In the input box, start by entering your melody's initial sequence, using a pattern of numbers and dashes. Each number represents a specific musical note, while each dash ("-") represents a beat duration, with one dash equaling 0.25 of a beat. For instance, a sequence like "55 _ _ _ 64 _ _ _ 64 _ 64 _ 64 _ _ _ 62 _ 62 _ 62 _ _ _ _ _ 60" will set your melody's rhythm and notes.

Once you've crafted your sequence, simply press the Create button, and within moments, your unique melody will appear on the screen, ready to play. You can even download it as a MIDI file to use in other projects or share with friends!
